\begin{itemize}
\item What other ways of choosing and modifying the $k$ value in an elitist schema overlay will produce better behavior, and why?

\item What other strategies exist for creating effective genetic overlays?

\item Would elitist schema overlays benefit from stochastic construction and application methodologies?
