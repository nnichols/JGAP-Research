\subsection*{Further Research}
During our research, we came across and developed several unanswered questions that could be the focus of further research into elitist schema overlays.

\begin{itemize}
\item What other ways of choosing and modifying the $k$ value in an elitist schema overlay will produce better behavior, and why?

\item What other strategies exist for creating effective genetic overlays?

\item Would elitist schema overlays benefit from stochastic construction and application methodologies?

\item Why do the different percent values for $k$ perform so differently from each other, especially in terms of convergence?
\end{itemize}
