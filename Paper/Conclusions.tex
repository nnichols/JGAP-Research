Our data supports the hypothesis that multi-parent strategies are an improvement upon traditional Genetic Algorithms. When paired with traditional Genetic Algorithms, elitist schema overlays did improve performance; however, these gains in performance disappeared when used in conjunction with other multi-parent strategies. The benefits of multi-parent strategies, including elitist schema overlays, can be seen in the significant performance differences on the tested instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem.

\subsection*{Further Research}
During our research, we came across and developed several unanswered questions that could be the focus of further research into elitist schema overlays and multi-parent Genetic Algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
\item What other ways of choosing and modifying the $k$ value in an elitist schema overlay will produce better behavior, and why?

\item What other strategies exist for creating effective genetic overlays?

\item Why do the different percent values for $k$ perform so differently from each other, especially in terms of convergence?

\item Why do elitist schema overlays only produce gains when used in conjunction with traditional Genetic Algorithms, and degrade performance when used with other multi-parent genetic operators?
\end{itemize}
