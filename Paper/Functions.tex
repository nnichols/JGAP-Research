Genetic Algorithms are frequently compared based upon their abilities to solve various benchmark numerical functions and real world problems like the Traveling Salesman and Job Scheduling problems\cite{molga05}. In order to get a good grasp on the general behavior of elitist schemata overlays in comparison to the other tested operators, we will choose a variety of problems from both of these fields. 
A common set of problems mentioned can be found in the existing research\cite{Eiben95}\cite{Tsutsui99}\cite{Deb99}. We will also test performance on several instances of the Traveling Salesman and Knapsack problems. Additionally, since multi-parent recombination operators have had success on NK-Landscapes in previous studies, we will test each genetic operator on several NK-Landscapes of varying size and ruggedness\cite{Eiben96}\cite{Skellett05}. Definitions from current research for these problems and several of their characteristics can be found below\cite{molga05}\cite{yang10}.
