The literature concerning multi-parent genetic operators highlighted two central operators: fitness-based scanning and diagonal crossover. These two strategies have shown success as multi-parent genetic operators, and are the direct conceptual descendants of traditional genetic operators.

\subsection*{Fitness-Based Scanning}
The first operator from the literature that has been implemented and tested is fitness-based scanning as proposed by Eiben, et al\cite{Eiben94}. The generalized form of scanning iterates through the empty genetic sequence of a child and determines its value based upon the values present in $n$ selected parents\cite{Eiben91}. Fitness-based scanning makes a roulette wheel selection to choose each allele. This procedure is further demonstrated in Figure-\ref{FBScan}. At each allele, the probability that a parent, from the population $S$, named $i$ with a fitness value of $f(i)$, will donate its allele to the child's genetic sequence has probability $P(i)$ as described below\cite{Eiben94}: 

\[ P(i) = \frac{f(i)}{\sum\limits_{i \in S} f(i)} \]

\noindent Thus, the expected number of alleles inherited from a parent $i$ is $E(i)$\cite{Eiben94}:

\[ E(i) = P(i) *(\text{ Chromosome length }) \]

			}
		}	
		$\child[\aye] \gets \SP[\aye]$

	}

\subsection*{Diagonal Crossover}
Traditional crossover takes two genetic sequences, chooses a splitting point, and swaps the portions after that point to create two new genetic sequences. \emph{Diagonal crossover} was introduced by Eiben, et al. to extend the concept of crossover into the realm of multi-parent genetic operators\cite{Eiben03}. A diagonal crossover of arity $n$ can be described easily. Take $n$ individuals from a population, select $n-1$ crossover points, and create $n$ children by selecting one segment from each piece of the genetic sequences given\cite{Eiben95}. Figure-\ref{DC-Fig} depicts how this would work\cite{Eiben95}:
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | }
\hline
$a_1$ & $a_2$ & $a_3$ & $a_4$ & $\text{ parent a }$ 	\\ \hline
$b_1$ & $b_2$ & $b_3$ & $b_4$ & $\text{ parent b }$ 	\\ \hline
$c_1$ & $c_2$ & $c_3$ & $c_4$ & $\text{ parent c }$ 	\\ \hline
$d_1$ & $d_2$ & $d_3$ & $d_4$ & $\text{ parent d }$ 	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
$\rightarrow$
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | }
\hline
$a_1$ & $d_2$ & $c_3$ & $b_4$ & $\text{ child a }$ 	\\ \hline
$b_1$ & $a_2$ & $d_3$ & $c_4$ & $\text{ child b }$ 	\\ \hline
$c_1$ & $b_2$ & $a_3$ & $d_4$ & $\text{ child c }$ 	\\ \hline
$d_1$ & $c_2$ & $b_3$ & $a_4$ & $\text{ child d }$ 	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

The rationale behind expanding this operator was to increase the disruptiveness, and by extension the explorativity, of traditional crossover\cite{Eiben97}. This meant that the population would need a large degree of similar genetic sequences before the search would narrow and converge\cite{Eiben95}. It should also be noted that in the special case of $n = 2$ is identical to traditional 1-point crossover\cite{Eiben95}.
