In this paper we explore the use of \emph{genetic overlays} in multi-parent Genetic Algorithms, focusing on those that utilize the common genetic sequences of the elite members of a population. These \emph{elitist schemata} will be used to bias the global search towards the region centered about the best known solutions. The parameters that drive the behavior of elitist schema overlays have been investigated, and successful models have been compared to current multi-parent and traditional genetic operators.
