In this paper we explore the use of \emph{genetic overlays} in multi-parent Genetic Algorithms, focusing on those that utilize the common genetic sequences of the elite members of a population. These \emph{elitist schemata} will be used to bias the global search towards the region centered about the best known solutions. The parameters that drive this operator have been investigated, with the best performing examples compared to successful multi-parent and traditional genetic operators.
