The theoretical foundations of Genetic Algorithms, the schema theorem and the building-block hypothesis, state that the success of Genetic Algorithms stems from the propagation of high performing subsequences. Multi-parent paradigms have shown that disruptive genetic operators help prevent the propagation of suboptimal subsequences by increasing the number of parents needed to be in agreeance before widespread propagation occurs. In this paper we explore the use of a novel genetic operator, the \emph{elitist schema overlays}, which propagates the matching segments in the genetic sequences of the elite subpopulation to bias the global search towards the region centered about the best known solutions. The parameters that drive the behavior of elitist schema overlays have been investigated to determine the most successful models. The highest performing elitist schema overlay model was then compared to successful multi-parent and traditional genetic operators.
