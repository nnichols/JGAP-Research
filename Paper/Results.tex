\subsection*{JGAP}
To implement the operators and benchmarks described earlier, we have built upon the JGAP framework. JGAP is an open source Genetic Algorithms package for the Java programming language developed by Meffert et al \cite{jgap}. This paper implemented the code from version 3.6.2, which was the latest stable release at the time this paper was written.
