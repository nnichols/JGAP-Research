\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank Dr. Mark Liffiton for guiding me through this research project. Additionally, I would also like to Illinois Wesleyan University for providing both Dr. Liffiton and Dr. Andrew Shallue the resources to fund the cluster used for this research, and for allowing me to utilize it. I would also like to extend thanks to Professor Pablo Moscato and Professor Gusz Eiben for their time and for suggesting additional readings. Klaus Meffert and the team behind JGAP were also very helpful and generous for releasing their code as open source software.
